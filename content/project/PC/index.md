title: "Potential Contrasting"
summary: Potential contrasting is an efficient method for learning a potential energy function that can reproduce an ensemble of molecular conformations. It can be easily applied to can learn coarse-grained force fields based on all-atom simulations. It generalizes the noise contrastive esitmation method to use complex unnormalized noise distributions constructed using molecular dynamics techniques such as umbrella sampling.
