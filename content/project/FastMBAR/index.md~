title: "FastMBAR"
summary: FastMBAR is a Python solver for large scale MBAR/UWHAM equations running on both CPUs and GPUs. It can compute relative free energies of a large number of thermodynamic states used in alchemical free energy calculations and calculating potential of mean force (PMF) in umbrella sampling and temperature/Hamiltonian replica exchange simulations.
