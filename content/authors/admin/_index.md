Hello! Welcome to my homepage!

I am a postdoctoral associate in the [Zhang Lab](https://zhanggroup.mit.edu) at MIT.
My current research of interest includes

* Understanding chromosome strucures and dynamics using both data-driven statistical modeling and physics-based modeling;
* Applying deep learning methods, especially deep generative models, to problems in computational chemistry and biophysics,
  such as free energy calculation, enhanced sampling, and extracting useful information from  molecular dynamics simulations.
* Connecting deep generative models with non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

During my PhD study, I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Charles L. Brooks III](https://brooks.chem.lsa.umich.edu).
The focuses of my PhD research include developing theorectical/computational methods for protein-ligand docking and free energy calculation and applying
deep generative models to study protein evolution, fitness landscape and stablity.

I love collaborating with both theoretical and experimental researchers, so feel free to contact me if you have a project for which my expertise might be helpful.
